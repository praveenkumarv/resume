        <h1>Aboutâ€¦ well, me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>I'm a self taught front-end developer, graphics designer, and often times musician, with over a decade of experience. I'm open minded and, although I work remotely, I do love exchanging ideas with other developers from around the world.</p>
            <p>My go-to stylesheets preprocessor is Sass with Neat for laying things out. I use Babel to transpile my ES6 modules into browser-friendly Javascript, bundled with either Browserify or Webpack. I work with frontend frameworks like Angular, though I enjoy smaller libraries with a lighter footprint like Vue.js the most.</p>
            <p>I thrive to keep current with the latest development trends while not overlooking battle-tested technologies. I'm also an Open Source enthusiast. I participate in OSS projects and I start my own rather frequently.</p>
            <p>Like many front-end developers switching to full-stack I like to build service-oriented, real-time applications. I use Node, Feathers, web sockets, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL.</p>
